Digital Infrastructure Cost Estimator (DICE)
============================================

This repository is the home of the `DICE` model.

While universal broadband infrastructure cost modeling is an established field, most assessments are usually carried out at the national level for a single country. 

Although country-specific assessments are extremely important for providing highly detailed strategic information, a key weakness is that such approaches have poor external statistical generalization of the key findings to other contexts. 

Indeed, only recently have research efforts begun to take more of a cross-country global assessment approach, utilizing harmonized global datasets for model inputs, to provide enhanced systematic insight across many markets. 

A key challenge in enabling this type of assessment has been developing a model, both general and flexible enough, to account for many different country contexts. This is the contribution DICE makes.
